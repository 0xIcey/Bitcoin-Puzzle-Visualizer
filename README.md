# Bitcoin-Puzzle-Visualizer

This repo can be used to visualize different aspects about the [Bitcoin Puzzles](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306983) that have been [solved](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx) so far, in the hopes of finding patterns to accelerate the finding of new Private Keys.

The main thing provided by this repo is the puzzles.json file, which I handcrafted to run analysis on. Attached is a basic script to visualize the data in 'blocks' of their difficulty. You can rewrite this code however you seem fit.

It can be built and run using `npm i && tsc && node release/app`, it requires Typescript and Node to be compiled.

If you do find some Bitcoin with the help of this, feel free to leave me a tip <3 <br>
